# Seng480D-Quantum-Algorithms-and-Software-Engineering
This cross-listed course — graduate and 4th year undergraduate course — focuses on the fundamentals of quantum computation, quantum algorithms, quantum software engineering, and hybrid quantum-classical problem solving. The course will address the challenges of practical hybrid development including algorithm design, data management, problem decomposition, variational circuit design, software infrastructure, tool integration, and debugging. Hybrid approaches provide significant opportunities for application developers to tackle hard problems that have been considered intractable using merely classical approaches. The most promising hybrid algorithms and architectures provide avenues for developers to scale quantum applications gradually, and for educators to train the workforce incrementally. This course will discuss key variational quantum algorithms (VQA) for optimization and simulation problems, including variational quantum phase estimation (VQPE), variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and quantum approximate optimization algorithm technique (QAOA). As for any other hybrid approach, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) involve many software architecture and design.
